# rustsampleuselib

This repo should demonstrate how to import and use a rust function from another repo.

# hint1 

Make sure you reference the right branch, "master" is no longer the default everywhere (github switched to "main" for new repositories).

    [dependencies]
    rustsamplelib = { git = "https://github.com/jhiver/rustsamplelib", branch="main" }

# give credits where it's due
